Christopher Bohorquez IT266 Game Mod Development Fall 2022
Quake 4 Pokemon Mod

This project takes the source code for Quake 4 and modifies it to a pokemon Turn Based combat game:

- Create a desktop shortcut that automatically launches the mod
- README.md that explains the mod and its features
- Modified Main Menu
    - The main menu has been modified to fit the Pokemon theme colors slightly.
- Modified Heads Up Display (HUD) reflecting a key feature of the mod
    - The HUD has been modified to count the turns for each battle. 
- In-Game Help Screen explaining mod changes
  - Using the command god (which is needed for the mod) will show a small help screen to explain how to start the turn based fighting. The rest will be shown.
- Turn-Based Combat System
    - Make it so it is a turn based battle system instead of a free FPS shooter
- Capture and Deploy System
  - Uses the basic blaster to capture enemies once they have been dealt some form of damage.
- 5 different collectible monsters
    - I made it so 5 different monsters can be collected, but you can only have one at a time.
- 4 actions per monster
    - Each monster has a set of moves including 2 attacks, 1 debuff, and 1 buff.
- 5 usable items
    - Added usable potions and buffs as well as a revive that can only be used once, but it can only be used once your HP hits 0
